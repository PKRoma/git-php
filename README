This is only a rough unsorted collection
of informations. The original git-php
had no README at all :-(

To setup git.php:

- edit config.php
- mkdir $repo_directory/.cache
  with appropiate permissions

Supposed directory structure:
$repo_directory-\
                |
                +-$cache_name
                |
                +-$secret_name
                |
                +-$bundle_name
                |
                +-project1 / .git
                |
                +-project2 / .git
                |
                ...
